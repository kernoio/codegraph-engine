# Dynamic-Dispatch Coverage Playbook

**Audience:** a Claude agent continuing this work.
**Mission:** systematically close static-extraction coverage holes for **dynamic
dispatch** across **every language and framework codegraph supports**, and validate
each one the same way, so cross-symbol *flows* exist in the graph everywhere.

> This is the top-level playbook. The deep design for one mechanism (the callback
> synthesizer) is in [`callback-edge-synthesis.md`](./callback-edge-synthesis.md).
> Full investigation context + findings: auto-memory `project_codegraph_read_displacement`.

## 1. The goal (why this matters)

codegraph's value is being **the map** — answering structural/flow questions
(`trace`, `impact`, callers, "how does X reach Y") that grep/Read cannot. Agents
will use codegraph instead of Read **only when it is sufficient**. We proved
empirically (see memory) that the lever for sufficiency is **coverage**, not
prompting/hooks/new-tools: when a flow is missing from the graph, the agent reads
the files to reconstruct it; when the flow *is* in the graph, the agent can answer
completely without reading.

**Validated end-to-end on excalidraw:** after closing the update-flow hole, 2/3
headless agent runs answered the "how does an update reach the screen" question with
**Read 0 and a complete answer** — impossible before, because the key edge wasn't in
the graph. (Caveat: coverage *enables* the no-read path; agent confirm-by-reading
variance means it doesn't *force* it. Completeness improves unconditionally.)

The mission is to make that true for **all** languages/frameworks.

---

## 2. The problem class: dynamic dispatch

Static tree-sitter extraction captures explicit calls (`foo()`, `this.bar()`). It
**misses** any call whose target is computed/indirect. Four recurring shapes, with a
**difficulty gradient** (do the cheap ones first):

| # | Shape | Example | Fix mechanism | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Named attribute / descriptor** | django `self._iterable_class(self)` | framework resolver (`claimsReference` + `resolve()`) | **cheap** |
| 2 | **Field-backed observer** | `onUpdate(cb)` + `for(cb of cbs)cb()` | callback synthesizer (whole-graph pass) | medium |
| 3 | **String-keyed EventEmitter** | `on('e',fn)` / `emit('e')` | callback synthesizer (event-keyed) | medium |
| 4 | **Inline callback handler** | `on('e', function h(){})` / `() => {}` | extraction (named) + synthesizer link-through-body (anon) | named: cheap · anon: hard |

Key distinction driving the mechanism choice:
- **A named ref exists** to resolve (`_iterable_class` is an attribute name) → **resolver**.
- **No ref exists** (`cb()` is anonymous; needs registrar↔dispatcher correlation) → **synthesizer**.

---

## 3. Worked examples (the two mechanisms, end to end)

### 3a. Django ORM descriptor — the **resolver** pattern (Python)
- **Hole:** `QuerySet._fetch_all` calls `self._iterable_class(self)` (a runtime-chosen
  iterable, default `ModelIterable`), whose `__iter__` runs the SQL compiler. Static
  parsing can't resolve the attribute-as-callable → `_fetch_all`'s only callee was
  `_prefetch_related_objects`; `trace(_fetch_all, execute_sql)` returned no path.
- **Fix:** `djangoResolver` claims the unresolved `_iterable_class` ref through the
  name-exists pre-filter, then resolves it to `ModelIterable.__iter__`.
- **Files:** `src/resolution/types.ts` (`claimsReference?` on `FrameworkResolver`),
  `src/resolution/index.ts` (pre-filter in `resolveOne` consults `claimsReference`),
  `src/resolution/frameworks/python.ts` (`djangoResolver.resolve` + `claimsReference` +
  `resolveModelIterableIter`).
- **Result:** `trace(_fetch_all, execute_sql)` → `_fetch_all → __iter__ → execute_sql` (3 hops).

### 3b. Excalidraw observer + EventEmitter — the **synthesizer** (TS)
- **Hole:** `Scene.triggerUpdate` does `for (cb of this.callbacks) cb()`; `triggerRender`
  is registered via `scene.onUpdate(this.triggerRender)`. The `triggerUpdate →
  triggerRender` edge is dynamic → `trace` returned no path; the whole update flow broke.
- **Fix:** a whole-graph pass that detects registrar/dispatcher channels, correlates
  registration sites, and synthesizes `dispatcher → callback` edges. Plus extraction of
  **named** inline callbacks so handlers like express's `function onmount(){}` are nodes.
- **Files:** `src/resolution/callback-synthesizer.ts` (the pass — field observers +
  EventEmitter), `src/resolution/index.ts` (calls `synthesizeCallbackEdges()` at the end
  of `resolveAndPersistBatched`), `src/extraction/tree-sitter.ts` (`visitFunctionBody`
  extracts named nested functions).
- **Result:** `trace(mutateElement, triggerRender)` → 3 hops; express `use → onmount`.

---

## 4. The repeatable methodology (run this per language/framework)

### Step 1 — Pick the framework's canonical *flow* question
Every framework has a signature data/control flow. Pick the "how does X reach/become Y"
question and a real repo (add to `.claude/skills/agent-eval/corpus.json`). Examples:
- React state→DOM, Vue reactive→render, Svelte store→update
- Rails request→controller→view, Spring request→`@Controller`→service
- Express/Koa request→middleware→handler, FastAPI request→route→dependency
- Redux action→reducer→store, RxJS subscribe→operator→observer
- Any ORM: query builder → SQL execution (django pattern)

### Step 2 — Measure the hole (deterministic, no agent)
```bash
rm -rf <repo>/.codegraph && ( cd <repo> && codegraph init -i )
node scripts/agent-eval/probe-trace.mjs <repo> <from-symbol> <to-symbol>   # does the flow break? where?
node scripts/agent-eval/probe-node.mjs  <repo> <break-symbol>              # trail: is the next hop missing?
```
A "No direct call path … breaks at dynamic dispatch" + a sparse trail at the break
point **locates the hole** (this is exactly how `_iterable_class` and `triggerUpdate`
were found). Confirm it's dynamic by reading the break symbol's body.

### Step 3 — Classify → choose the mechanism (use the §2 table)
- `self.<attr>(...)` / descriptor / metaclass → **resolver** (§3a).
- `for(cb of store)cb()` / `store.forEach(cb=>cb())` → **field-observer synthesizer** (§3b).
- `on('e',fn)` + `emit('e')` → **EventEmitter synthesizer** (§3b).
- Inline handler not a node → **named:** extraction (already done generically in
  `tree-sitter.ts`); **anonymous:** synthesizer link-through-body (not yet built).

### Step 4 — Implement
- **Resolver:** add to `src/resolution/frameworks/<lang>.ts` — a `resolve()` branch +
  `claimsReference(name)` if the ref name isn't a declared symbol. Copy `djangoResolver`.
- **Synthesizer channel:** extend `src/resolution/callback-synthesizer.ts` — add the
  framework's registrar/dispatcher **name patterns** and **body patterns** (e.g. signals
  use `.connect()`/`.emit()`; Rx uses `.subscribe()`/`.next()`).
- Reindex (Step 2 command) and re-run `probe-trace` — the flow should now connect.

### Step 5 — Validate (the same way every time)
1. **Deterministic:** `probe-trace(from,to)` finds the path; `probe-node` shows the
   bridged hop. The previously-broken hop is closed.
2. **Precision:** count + spot-check synthesized/resolved edges — no explosion, correct targets:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 <repo>/.codegraph/codegraph.db \
     "select s.name||' → '||t.name||'  '||coalesce(e.metadata,'') from edges e \
      join nodes s on e.source=s.id join nodes t on e.target=t.id where e.provenance='heuristic';"
   ```
   (Resolver edges aren't `heuristic`; verify via the trace + callees instead.)
3. **Regression:** node count stable (`select count(*) from nodes;` before/after — a big
   jump means an extraction change over-fired); existing traces on a control repo intact.
4. **End-to-end agent eval:** run the flow question with codegraph and measure
   **reads / answer-completeness / cost** vs a pre-fix baseline:
   ```bash
   # headless (exact cost + clean tool sequence)
   bash scripts/agent-eval/run-agent.sh <repo> with "<flow question>"
   # or the full A/B + interactive Explore-subagent path:
   scripts/agent-eval/audit.sh local <name> <url> "<flow question>" all
   ```
   Then parse: `Read` count, codegraph-tool count, cost, and whether the answer now
   contains the glue symbols (the ones that previously required a read).

### Success criteria (per language/framework)
- `trace` finds the canonical flow end-to-end (no dynamic-dispatch break).
- Agent can answer the flow question with **Read 0** (achievable in ≥ some runs) and the
  glue symbols appear in the answer.
- **No node explosion** and no regression on a control repo.
- Synthesized edges are precise on a spot-check (no generic-name over-linking).

## 5. Validation toolkit (reference)

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/agent-eval/probe-trace.mjs <repo> <from> <to>` | call-path between two symbols (the hole detector) |
| `scripts/agent-eval/probe-node.mjs <repo> <sym> [code]` | symbol + trail (callers/callees); `code` adds the body |
| `scripts/agent-eval/probe-context.mjs <repo> "<task>"` | context output incl. call-paths |
| `scripts/agent-eval/probe-explore.mjs <repo> "<query>"` | explore output |
| `scripts/agent-eval/{audit,run-agent,itrun}.sh` | agent A/B (headless + interactive); also the `/agent-eval` skill |
| `sqlite3 <repo>/.codegraph/codegraph.db` | direct edge/node inspection (provenance, metadata, counts) |

Probe scripts use the built `dist/` — run `npm run build` first. Reindex after any
extraction or resolution change (`rm -rf <repo>/.codegraph && codegraph init -i`) — the
synthesizer/resolvers run at index time. Test fixtures: keep a tiny per-pattern fixture
(see `/tmp/cb-fixture/bus.js`; **move into `__tests__/`** when shipping).

## 7. Known limits & gotchas (from the excalidraw/django work)

- **Coverage enables, doesn't force, the no-read path.** Agents still read to *confirm
  source* sometimes; cost stays ~flat (codegraph calls trade for reads). The reliable
  win is **completeness** + making Read-0 *possible*. Don't expect a guaranteed cost drop.
- **Vue (validated 2026-05-23, vitepress S / vben M / element-plus L).** SFC `<template>`
  is unparsed by the extractor, so template usage needs synthesis (`vueTemplateEdges`):
  `@click="fn"` → handler, kebab `<el-button>` → `ElButton`. PascalCase `<Child/>` is
  already covered by the JSX channel (the SFC component node spans the template). Result:
  agent reads drop in every size (vben login 1–3 vs 4–11), **strongest where handlers are
  local functions** (vben `handleLogin`/`handleSubmit`).
  **Composable-destructure handlers RESOLVED:** `@click="closeSidebar"` where
  `const { close: closeSidebar } = useSidebarControl()` now follows alias → composable →
  the returned `close` fn (when it's defined in the composable's file). vitepress sidebar
  flow dropped **6 → 0 reads** (best case). Precise-only — no fallback to the composable
  itself (the static `useX()` call edge already covers that), so it adds nothing where the
  returned fn can't be located (e.g. re-exported / external composable). Remaining limits:
  **prefix-convention kebab** — element-plus `el-button` → `button.vue` (component named
  `button`, not `ElButton`), so kebab stays unresolved there; and **reactive→render**
  (vue-core Proxy runtime) — the deep framework-internal frontier, deferred.
- **Difficulty gradient is real:** named-ref dispatch (resolver) is cheap; anonymous
  callback dispatch (synthesizer) is medium; **anonymous-arrow handlers are the hard
  remaining gap** (no identity → need synthesizer link-through-body, not yet built).
- **Extraction changes are high blast radius.** The Phase-3 named-inline-callback
  extraction is in the *shared* `tree-sitter.ts` walker — re-check **node counts across
  several languages** after any extraction change (it held at +3 on excalidraw because
  anonymous arrows are skipped).
- **Synthesizer precision guards:** registrar-name uniqueness, named-only handlers, and
  an event **fan-out cap** (skip generic events like `error`/`change`). Receiver-type
  matching (via `type_of` edges) is the planned precision upgrade — deferred.
- **As-built shortcuts** (callback synthesizer): pairs registrar/dispatcher by *file*+field
  (class proxy), regex arg-recovery (named refs only), `provenance:'heuristic'` +
  `metadata.synthesizedBy` (the enum has no `'callback-synthesis'`). See the design doc.
- **Synthesizer runs only in `resolveAndPersistBatched`** (full index) — wire into
  `resolveAndPersist` for incremental sync before shipping.
- **Symbol ambiguity in `trace`:** common names (`render`, `execute_sql`) match many
  nodes; trace picks among them and may start from the wrong one. Trace from the specific
  method, not a class name.

## 8. Definition of done (the whole mission)

For each language × framework: the canonical flow `trace`s end-to-end, an agent can
answer the flow question with Read 0 in at least some runs with the glue present, no node
explosion, no regression — recorded in the matrix (§6) with the validating repo + numbers.
Then ship-prep: tests per mechanism, CHANGELOG, wire incremental, commit.
